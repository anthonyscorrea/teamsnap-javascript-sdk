Javascript SDK for TeamSnap's APIv3

Usage
-----

For use on the web:

Download `teamsnap.js` or `teamsnap.min.js` from the `dist/` folder and include
it on your page. Note: it will not work on IE8 or IE9 because of cross domain
incompatabilities. A proxy will need to be set up on your own domain (nginx
example below).

NOTE: We do not recommend using this library on node.js at this time.

Check the [Quick start guide](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-javascript-sdk/wiki/Quick-Start) in the [wiki](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-javascript-sdk/wiki) for more details or read through the [Collections](./docs/collections.md) documentation for a complete list of SDK methods.

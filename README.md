Usage
-----

For use on the web:

Download `teamsnap.js` or `teamsnap.min.js` from the `dist/` folder and include
it on your page. Note: it will not work on IE8 or IE9 because of cross domain
incompatabilities. A proxy will need to be set up on your own domain.

For use with node.js:

```
npm install --save teamsnap
```
